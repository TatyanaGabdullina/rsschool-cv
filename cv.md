### About me
###### I graduated from St. Petersburg University with a degree in applied mathematics. For about 20 years I worked as a Graphic designer. Now I moved to Slovakia. I am studying at Comenius University for information studies. I am working as a Graphic Design teacher with teenagers. I know a little bit of HTML and CSS, I would like to improve my knowledge and learn JS.
